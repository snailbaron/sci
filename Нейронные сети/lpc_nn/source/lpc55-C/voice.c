***************************************************************************
*
*        Voicing Detection (VOICIN) makes voicing decisions for each half
*   frame of input speech.  Tentative voicing decisions are made two frames
*   in the future (2F) for each half frame.  These decisions are carried
*   through one frame in the future (1F) to the present (P) frame where
*   they are examined and smoothed, resulting in the final voicing
*   decisions for each half frame. 
*        The voicing parameter (signal measurement) column vector (VALUE)
*   is based on a rectangular window of speech samples determined by the
*   window placement algorithm.  The voicing parameter vector contains the
*   AMDF windowed maximum-to-minimum ratio, the zero crossing rate, energy
*   measures, reflection coefficients, and prediction gains.  The voicing
*   window is placed to avoid contamination of the voicing parameter vector
*   with speech onsets. 
*        The input signal is then classified as unvoiced (including
*   silence) or voiced.  This decision is made by a linear discriminant
*   function consisting of a dot product of the voicing decision
*   coefficient (VDC) row vector with the measurement column vector
*   (VALUE).  The VDC vector is 2-dimensional, each row vector is optimized
*   for a particular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  So, before the dot
*   product is performed, the SNR is estimated to select the appropriate
*   VDC vector. 
*        The smoothing algorithm is a modified median smoother.  The
*   voicing discriminant function is used by the smoother to determine how
*   strongly voiced or unvoiced a signal is.  The smoothing is further
*   modified if a speech onset and a voicing decision transition occur
*   within one half frame.  In this case, the voicing decision transition
*   is extended to the speech onset.  For transmission purposes, there are
*   constraints on the duration and transition of voicing decisions.  The
*   smoother takes these constraints into account. 
*        Finally, the energy estimates are updated along with the dither
*   threshold used to calculate the zero crossing rate (ZC).
